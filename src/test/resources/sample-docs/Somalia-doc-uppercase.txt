WHILE SIGNIFICANT MILITARY GAINS HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE BATTLE AGAINST AL QAEDA-LINKED REBELS IN SOMALIA, FOREIGN POWERS ARE FRUSTRATED AT THE SLOW PACE OF CHANGE IN A POLITICAL SYSTEM PLAGUED BY CORRUPTION AND INFIGHTING.

“IN RECENT WEEKS, THERE HAS BEEN A SCRAMBLE TO RETURN TO OR VISIT MOGADISHU. UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY GENERAL BAN KI-MOON DROPPED IN. AFTER MANY YEARS, THE UN MOVED ITS SOMALIA OFFICE FROM NAIROBI BACK TO MOGADISHU. THE CHINESE AND EUROPEANS HAVE KNOCKED ON DOORS IN MOGADISHU AND LEFT CHEQUES BEHIND. THE TURKS SETTLED IN MUCH EARLIER. THE POLITICIANS IN MOGADISHU ARE JUST LOVING IT.”
“THE SHORT OF IT IS THAT SOMALIA IS NOW “RIPE” AND THE CARVING KNIVES ARE OUT. THE PLAYERS WHO HAVE PUT IN MONEY OR FOUGHT THE AL-SHABAAB MILITANTS ARE BEGINNING TO SHARE THE SPOILS.”

ON FEBRUARY 23 SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT FOR EAST AFRICA, AND INDEED ALL OF AFRICA, WILL HAPPEN IN LONDON.
THERE WILL BE A BIG CONFERENCE ON SOMALIA BY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT. FOR GOOD MEASURE, BRITAIN’S FOREIGN MINISTER WILLIAM HAGUE WAS IN MOGADISHU A FEW DAYS AGO, INSTALLING A NEW UK ENVOY.

HE NOTES THAT AMISOM HAS BEEN HELPING TO BUILD UP THE CAPABILITIES OF THE SOMALI POLICE FORCE WHO HAVE MANAGED TO DISRUPT THE MAJORITY OF PLANNED ATTACKS IN THE CITY.

THE AU SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR SOMALIA CONDOLES WITH THE BEREAVED FAMILY AND THE TRANSITIONAL FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (TFG) OF SOMALIA AND PRAYS FOR THE QUICK RECOVERY OF THE INJURED.

THE BRITISH OFFICE FOR SOMALIA CONDEMNED THE KILLING OF AT LEAST NINE PEOPLE IN THE ATTACK ON A CAFÉ NEAR HOTEL MUNA IN MOGADISHU. IT OFFERS ITS CONDOLENCES TO THE TRANSITIONAL FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, THE PEOPLE OF SOMALIA AND IN PARTICULAR THE FAMILIES OF THOSE WHO DIED. THIS ACT OF TERRORISM HAS YET AGAIN SHOWN A DISREGARD NOT JUST FOR THE SUFFERING OF THE SOMALI PEOPLE, WHO CONTINUE TO ENDURE THE EFFECTS OF 20 YEARS OF CONFLICT, BUT ALSO FOR HUMAN LIFE.

SPEAKING TODAY IN MOGADISHU, THE BRITISH AMBASSADOR TO SOMALIA, MATT BAUGH SAID:

“I CONDEMN THIS COWARDLY AND BARBARIC ACT. WE STAND SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH THE SOMALI PEOPLE AND ALL THOSE WHO ARE WORKING FOR A PEACEFUL AND STABLE SOMALIA.

MOHAMUD AHMED NOOR (TARZAN), THE GOVERNOR OF BANADIR REGION FOR TRANSITIONAL FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TFG HAS ON THURSDAY CALLED ON PEOPLE TO FIGHT AGAINST THE AL QAEDA LINKED MILITANTS GROUP OF AL SHABAAB WHO CARRIED OUT YESTERDAY’S DEADLY CAR BOMB ATTACK IN THE CAPITAL.
GIVING AN INTERVIEW TO SHABELLE MEDIA OVERNIGHT, THE GOVERNOR POINTED OUT THAT THE EXPLOSION AT MUNA HOTEL IN MOGADISHU ON WEDNESDAY WAS A ‘COWARDLY AND HEARTLESS ACT.’ AND HE SAID AL SHABAAB MILITANTS ARE TARGETING EVERYONE, NOT JUST GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND AMISOM SOLDIERS IN MOGADISHU.

WHEN ASKED MR. NOOR WHY SUCH DEADLY ATTACKS HAVE BECOME COMMON IN THE CAPITAL, HE SAID THE PERPETRATORS ARE HIDING AMONG THE POPULATION SO THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT CAPABLE OF PUTTING MORE SECURITY FORCES AT EVERY GATHERING IN SOMALIA CAPITAL MOGADISHU. THE SOMALI MILITANT GROUP AL SHABAAB CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK AT A CAFÉ NEAR MUNA HOTEL ON WEDNESDAY, SAYING THE TARGET WAS A RESTAURANT FREQUENTED BY SENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT AND INTELLIGENCE PERSONNEL.

AT LEAST FIVE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED AND SIX OTHERS WOUNDED IN A DEADLY FIGHT THAT ERUPTED BETWEEN TFG FORCES AND THE KENYAN TROOPS ON ONE SIDE AND AL SHABAAB REBEL FIGHTERS ON THE OTHER SIDE AT HOSINGOW, 160 KM WEST OF KISMAYO TOWN. THE FIGHT REPORTEDLY ERUPTED AFTER SEVERAL REBEL FIGHTERS RAIDED MILITARY BASES OF THE ALLIED FORCES, PROMPTING SEVERAL HOURS OF DEADLY FIGHTING.

TFG OFFICIALS IN THE AREA TOLD BAR-KULAN THAT THEY INFLICTED HEAVY CASUALTIES ON THE ATTACKERS, FORCING THEM TO RETREAT BACK TO THEIR BASES AND ARE ON HOT PURSUIT. THEY ADDED THAT THREE OF THEIR SOLDIERS WERE SLIGHTLY INJURED DURING THE FIGHT.

AL SHABAAB ISLAMISTS USUALLY CLAIM EXPLOSIONS IN MOGADISHU WHICH TARGET CROWDED AREAS, KILLING AND INJURING CIVILIANS. THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD ACT TO PREVENT SUCH EXPLOSIONS.

NORMALCY HAS REPORTEDLY RETURNED TO GALKAYO’S HORUMAR NEIGHBOURHOOD FOLLOWING YESTERDAY’S DEADLY CLASHES BETWEEN PUNTLAND FORCES AND ARMED LOCAL CLAN MILITIAS FROM GALMUDUG ADMINISTERED SOUTHERN PART OF THE CITY.

AT LEAST 15 PEOPLE WERE KILLED BY A SUICIDE BOMBER FROM THE AL QAEDA LINKED AL SHABAAB, OFFICIALS SAID THURSDAY, AS DETAILS EMERGED OF THE HEAVY BLAST IN SOMALIA’S WAR-TORN CAPITAL MOGADISHU. ”THE HORRIBLE SUICIDE BLAST, CARRIED OUT BY DESPERATE AND VIOLENT CRIMINALS, KILLED AT LEAST 15 INNOCENT CIVILIANS, WHILE 20 OTHERS ARE INJURED,” SAID MOGADISHU MAYOR MOHAMED AHMED NUR, UPDATING AN INITIAL TOLL OF 11.

NUR SAID TWO LAWMAKERS WERE ALSO SLIGHTLY INJURED IN THE BLAST WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AT A SMALL CAFE WHERE PEOPLE HAD GATHERED TO DRINK TEA, IN THE HEART OF THE GOVERNMENT QUARTER AND CLOSE TO THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE.

“THEY ARE COWARDS, ATTACKING SOFT TARGETS — INNOCENT PEOPLE DRINKING TEA,” NUR SAID OF THE ATTACK, THE LATEST IN A STRING OF BLASTS INCLUDING ROADSIDE BOMBS AND GRENADE EXPLOSIONS THAT HAVE ROCKED THE SOMALI CAPITAL. EXTREMIST AL SHABAAB FIGHTERS SAID THEIR ATTACK HAD TARGETED GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AT THE NEARBY MUNA HOTEL, A SITE INFAMOUS FOR AN AUGUST 2010 ATTACK WHEN AL SHABAAB SUICIDE GUNMEN KILLED 32 PEOPLE INCLUDING SIX LAWMAKERS.

A SOMALI DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY MINISTER HAS EXPRESSED DISAPPOINTMENT OVER WEDNESDAY’S SUICIDE CAR BOMBING OUTSIDE A HOTEL IN THE CAPITAL, MOGADISHU. AT LEAST 15 PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN THE ATTACK AND DOZENS MORE WOUNDED, INCLUDING SOMALI PARLIAMENT MEMBERS. THE MILITANT GROUP AL SHABAAB CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY. ABDIHAKIM EGEH, SOMALIA’S DEPUTY INTERIOR NATIONAL SECURITY MINISTER SAID THE BOMBINGS WILL NOT PREVENT THE SECURITY PROGRESS THAT HE SAID IS CURRENTLY TAKING PLACE IN MOGADISHU.

“FIRST OF ALL, ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT, I’D LIKE TO SEND OUR CONDOLENCES TO THE FAMILIES OF THOSE WHO LOST THEIR LIVES IN THAT COWARDLY ACT FROM YESTERDAY IN MOGADISHU, AND I’D ALSO LIKE TO WISH [A] SPEEDY RECOVERY TO THOSE WHO WERE INJURED IN THE ACT AS WELL,” HE SAID.LACK OF GOOD GOVERNANCE HAS MADE SOMALIA ALMOST UNGOVERNABLE FOR DECADES.  BUT EGEH SAID SOMALIS, ESPECIALLY THOSE IN CAPITAL MOGADISHU, HAVE STARTED TO REBUILD THEIR LIVES, THANKS TO RELATIVE SECURITY.

“AFTER OUR GOVERNMENT LIBERATED MOGADISHU, PEOPLE ARE COMING BACK TO THEIR HOUSES; THEY ARE COMING BACK TO REBUILD THEIR DESTROYED BUSINESSES AND HOUSES, AND, IT’S REALLY DEPRESSING TO SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS [WEDNESDAY’S BOMBING],” EGEH SAID. HE CREDITS SOMALI SECURITY FORCES AND AFRICAN UNION PEACEKEEPERS FOR THEIR ROLE IN BRING RELATIVE STABILITY TO MOGADISHU.

“I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THE STREETS OF MOGADISHU ARE BECOMING SAFER AND SAFER EVERY DAY, AND I’D LIKE TO TAKE THIS MOMENT TO THANK OUR SECURITY FORCES FOR MAKING THIS POSSIBLE,” THE DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY MINISTER SAID. EGEH SAID THE TRANSITIONAL FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS REACHED OUT TO AL SHABAB, BUT THE ISLAMIST GROUP HAS NOT RESPONDED IN KIND. “OUR DOORS ARE OPEN TO ANYONE WHO IS WILLING TO TALK TO US ABOUT BRINGING SOMALIA BACK TO WHAT IT USED TO BE,” EGEH SAID.

A NEW WAVE OF BATTLE-HARDENED ”LONE WOLF” TERRORISTS IS EXPECTED TO INFILTRATE BRITAIN AND THE US FROM AFRICAN AND OTHER WAR ZONES TO CARRY OUT ATTACKS, ACCORDING TO SECURITY EXPERTS. BRITISH AND AMERICAN SOMALIS CURRENTLY FIGHTING ALONGSIDE ISLAMIST REBELS IN SOMALIA ARE EXPECTED TO POSE A SERIOUS THREAT UPON THEIR RETURN FROM AFRICA, TRAINING OTHERS IN THE TECHNIQUES THEY LEARNT ON THE BATTLEFIELD AND IN TERRORIST TRAINING CAMPS.

”IT IS ONLY A QUESTION OF TIME BEFORE THEIR COMMITMENT TO THE CAUSE, AND THEIR NEWLY ACQUIRED EXPERTISE, ARE LIKELY TO BE SEEN ON BRITISH STREETS,” SAYS THE ROYAL UNITED SERVICES INSTITUTE, A LONDON-BASED DEFENCE THINK TANK.

RUSI, IN A REPORT TITLED THE GLOBAL ORIGINS OF NEW TERRORISM, SAYS ABOUT 50 FIGHTERS WITH THE ISLAMIST GROUP AL SHABAAB, WHICH IS AFFILIATED WITH AL-QAEDA, ARE FROM BRITAIN. THEY SAY THE NEW TERROR THREAT WILL ALSO COME FROM ISLAMIST FIGHTERS RETURNING FROM WARS IN YEMEN AND NIGERIA, AND FROM THE RENEWED VIOLENCE IN IRAQ. THE PREDICTIONS ARE ECHOED BY THE CONTROVERSIAL CHAIRMAN OF THE US HOUSE COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY, CONGRESSMAN PETER KING, WHO HAS WARNED OF THE THREAT TO THE US FROM AN ESTIMATED 50 AMERICAN SOMALIS FIGHTING WITH AL SHABAAB.

IN THE VOLATILE COUNTRY OF SOMALIA, THE FIGHT BETWEEN MILITANT GROUPS HAS SPILLED OVER ONTO TWITTER. THE MAIN OPPOSITION GROUP AL SHABAAB, AN AL QAEDA-LINKED SOMALI MILITIA, OFTEN USES THE SOCIAL MEDIA SITE TO PICK FIGHTS AND PROSELYTIZE TO WOULD-BE RECRUITS. ONE OF THE GROUPS THAT OPPOSES AL SHABAAB, THE SUFI ISLAMIST GROUP AHLU SUNNA WALJAMEA, ALSO USES TWITTER, BUT TO A FAR LESS SUCCESSFUL DEGREE.

COMPARED TO AL SHABAAB’S NEARLY 11,000 FOLLOWERS, AHLU SUNNA HAS ONLY 74. AND, WHILE AL SHABAAB’S CONTINUING TO TWEET ABOUT THE LATEST DISRUPTIVE VIOLENCE IT’S INFLICTING ON SOMALIA, AHLU SUNNA’S LAST TWEET OFFERED AN EASY WAY TO LOSE WEIGHT. IT’S NOT A NEW PROPAGANDA TACTIC. THE TWITTER STREAM APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN HACKED.

IT SEEMS A HARMLESS HACK, THOUGH WHOEVER DID BREAK INTO THE ACCOUNT TOOK IT ON THEMSELVES TO PRIVATELY MESSAGE (A DM IN TWITTER TALK) A JOURNALIST. JEREMY SCAHILL, THE NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT FOR THE NATION, WROTE, “HILARIOUS. SOMEONE HACKED SOMALI MILITIA AHLU SUNNA’S TWITTER. JUST GOT DM: ‘YOU SEEN WHAT THIS PERSON IS SAYING ABOUT YOU? TERRIBLE THINGS.’ ”

ON THE SCALE OF GROUPS HACKED JUST THIS WEEK, AHLU SUNNA IS A PRETTY LOW-PROFILE GROUP. OTHER VICTIMS: THE FBI, SYMANTEC, A HUGE ANTI-VIRUS COMPANY, AND SYRIAN PRESIDENT BASHAR AL-ASSAD.

“IN SPITE OF THE REMARKABLE MILESTONE THAT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED OVER THE LAST FIVE MONTHS, SOME WHO ARE SPEWING THE SAME RHETORIC ARE GAINING MOMENTUM TO UNDERMINE THE PEACE PROCESS WITHOUT OFFERING AN ALTERNATIVE TO PEACE PROCESS. IT’S REGRETTABLE, AND UNLESS AND UNTIL THESE TYPES OF PRETENTIOUS PERSONALITIES AND DOUBLE STANDARDS ARE PROPERLY DEALT WITH, WE WILL AGAIN FIND OURSELVES IN THE SAME DEAD END. ONE IMPORTANT LESSON TO TAKE AWAY FROM THIS HOWEVER IS THAT SOMALIA DEADLOCK CANNOT BE OVERCOME WHILE CLAN LEADERS, ENGAGING IN THE SORT OF MURKY POLITICS AND GRAY COMPROMISE.”

THE ROADMAP FACILITATED THE OPPORTUNITY OF HOSTING A SOMALI-OWNED CONFERENCE IN MOGADISHU AND GAROWE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SOMALIA’S POST-CIVIL WAR HISTORY; THE FIRST CONSULTATIVE MEETING ON ENDING THE TRANSITION WAS HELD IN MOGADISHU FROM SEPTEMBER 4-6, 2011, FOLLOWED BY GAROWE CONFERENCE IN WHICH WAS HELD FROM 21-23 DECEMBER, 2011. THE PROCESS OF THE ROADMAP IS SPELLED OUT IN A FIRST GRADE LEVEL LANGUAGE JUST TO MAKE SURE THERE ARE NOT DESCRIPENCES. THE MEETING WAS ADVERTIZED TO THE INTENDED STAKEHOLDERS. “INCLUSIVITY AND PARTICIPATION”:THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PRIORITY TASKS IN THE ROADMAP SHALL BE INCLUSIVE WITH PARTICIPATION OF THE TFG, TFP, PUNTLAND GOVERNMENT OF SOMALIA, GALMUDUG STATE OF SOMALIA, ASWJ AND CIVIL SOCIETY”.

THUS, THE ARGUMENT AGAINST ROADMAP IS ULTIMATELY AN ARGUMENT AGAINST REASON ITSELF. NOT THAT THE ROADMAP IS SUBSTITUTE FOR REASON; QUITE THE CONTRARY, IT IS A PRODUCT OF REASON AND IT ASSISTS US IN THE APPLICATION OF THE REASON. AS MUCH AS ONE MIGHT TEMPTED TO DISAGREE WITH THE PRINCIPLES OR PERHAPS SOME ELEMENTS OF THE ROADMAP, THE FACT IS THAT AN HONEST INSPECTION OF HISTORY REVEALS THAT SOMALIA HAS BEEN BOGGED DOWN FOR ITS OWN LEADERS REFUSING TO REACH A COLLABORATIVE SOLUTION. THE LACK OF PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE NEVER ENDING CRISIS AMONG OUR LEADERS WAS THE RATIONALE THAT LED THE CREATION OF THE ROADMAP.

THE “KAMPALA ACCORD” MEANT TO BE THE “STICK” WHILE THE ROADMAP WAS THE “CARROT” COMBINING A PROMISED REWARD WITH A THREATENING PUNISHMENT. “THE ROADMAP” LAYS OUT CLEAR BENCHMARKS WHILST KAMPALA ACCORD MANDATES, A WIDE RANGE OF MEASURES ADDRESSING ISSUES INCLUDING THREATS OF IMPEACHMENT OF THE PRESIDENT, SPEAKER, THE TWO DEPUTY SPEAKERS OF PARLIAMENT AS WELL AS THE DISMISSAL OF THE PARLIAMENT. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE ROADMAP EMPOWERS TRANSITIONAL FEDERAL INSTITUTIONS (TFI), PUT PRESSURE ONTO POLITICAL STAKE HOLDERS TO ENGAGE PEACE PROCESS INITIATIVES, AND TO END TRANSITIONAL PERIOD. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND THE OFFICE OF UNPOS ARE, HENCE, OBLIGED TO UPHOLD THE ONGOING ROADMAP INITIATIVE AND FORCEFULLY EXPEL ANYONE WHO ACTS OTHERWISE. IN ADDITION, THE ROADMAP MANDATES SET OF FACTORS AND BENCHMARKS THAT WILL (A) FINALIZE THE CONSTITUTION (B) DE QUANTIFY THE SIZE OF THE PARLIAMENTARIAN MEMBERS (C) AND ABOVE ALL, END THE TRANSITION PERIOD.
